    <h1>The SIV Token</h1>
    <h2>Permissionless Engagement using Powerful Cryptographic Tools</h2>
    <p>The SIV Token is a way for anyone and everyone to invest in the success of upgrading democracy's core system: voting.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Simple & Innovative Token Economics:</h2>
    <p>All future revenue that SIV earns from governments will be paid in USD dividends to SIV Token Holders.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Right Now...</h2>
    <p>
      The city of San Francisco (as one example) pays{' '}
      <b>
        <i>$25 per year per registered voter</i>
      </b>{' '}
      (whether they actually vote or not!) to Dominion Election Systems, for paper voting equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The US government — aka, we the taxpayers — spends $4 billion every year on election administration. $8b in 2020
      because of COVID.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>SIV has created far superior technology:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easier</li>
      <li>Faster </li>
      <li>End-to-end Verifiable </li>
      <li>Cryptographically Private </li>
      <li>Fully Auditable </li>
      <li>Pandemic-Resistant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This allows every day citizens like you and me to vote from the internet-connected supercomputers in our pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all in a way that creates <i>more trust</i> than the current election systems we use right now…
    </p>
    <p>
      SIV allows us to verify for ourselves that our vote is cast and counted correctly, without tampering, and allows
      each and every one of us to fully recount the vote for ourselves if we want.
    </p>
    <p>No more vote-counts trapped behind closed doors, behind any curtains. </p>
    <p>
      Each and every one of us can see for ourselves what the correct results are supposed to be — all{' '}

    <h2> But! There is one major barrier… </h2>
    <p>
      In order to be able to use Secure Internet Voting,{' '}
      <b>
        <i>we the citizens</i>
      </b>{' '}
      have to first be offered SIV as an option.
    </p>
    <p>This requires buy-in from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> our election officials — many of whom are hard-working, honest public servants!</li>
      <li>
        our state legislators — who are very busy, and have trouble knowing what citizens want them to prioritize!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This is where you come in!</h2>
    <p>
      We at <a href="https://siv.org">SIV.org</a> have spent the last 2 years reaching out and pitching to hundreds of
      election officials, throughout the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it’s been an uncountable number of hours, this is only a drop in the bucket, as throughout the US there
      are over 3000 counties running elections, each with many different people involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve heard from them over and over again: “I know electronic voting is the way things are of course eventually
      heading, but are we ready yet?” For VERY GOOD REASONS, these officials are technologically conservative &
      risk-averse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s naturally frightening to go first or try new things. Especially with something so vital as{' '}
      <b>
        <i>elections</i>
      </b>
      .
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>They need to SEE & HEAR from us voters that this is something we want.</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever you get the opportunity, it is valuable to tell them you want to be able to vote from your phone in an easy
      and secure way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being specific also helps: showing excitment about <a href="https://siv.org">SIV.org</a>, and that you'd like to be{' '}
      <a href="">able to try it out</a>!

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1. When can I start voting from my phone?</b>
    </p>

    <p>As soon as your local government will allow you.</p>
    <p>
      The technology is all ready, and we’ve run a number of highly successful private pilots. The core barrier left is
      state and local legislative action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the federal UOCAVA Act, Secretaries of State and local election officials do have some legal leeway to
      run small-scale pilots, especially for Overseas Voters (like military voters) and Disabled Voters. But these
      election officials can always use more public encouragement.

    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>3. Are governments equipped to use cryptocurrency?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether they are or not, governments never need to touch cryptocurrency to use Secure Internet Voting. The SIV
      Foundation interfaces with governments using the traditional financial infrastructure, ensuring the process is as
      easy and straightforward as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4. Is this partisan?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Absolutely not. Partisanship is artificially dividing our country, and getting in the way of us collaborating
      effectively. 99% of Americans agree on 99% of issues, but we find ourselves caught in Lesser-of-Two-Evils traps,
      strangling dialogue and empowering extremists.

    <p>
      <a href="https://siv.org/">SIV.org</a> strongly recommends{' '}

      Effect, and voting method reform more generally.
