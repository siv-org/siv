    <ul className="pl-1 space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <strong>Build Voter Confidence</strong>
        <br />
        Voters are more likely to participate when they know the system is accountable and secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Demonstrate Integrity</strong>
        <br />A financial guarantee is your public promise: votes will be counted—or voters will be compensated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Detect Issues Early</strong>
        <br />
        The guarantee incentivizes voters to check that their vote was included. This surfaces problems faster and
        increases transparency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible and Optional</strong>
        <br />
        You choose how much to guarantee. Start small, scale as needed.
