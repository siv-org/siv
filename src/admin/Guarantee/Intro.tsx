      <p>
        A <i>Vote Integrity Guarantee</i> gives you a way to <strong>back that trust with real assurance</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By funding this guarantee, you&apos;re making a public commitment: If any accepted votes are missing from the
        final tally, voters can claim a financial rewardâ€”paid from the funds you commit.
      </p>

    {/* How it works */}
    <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">How it works</h2>
    <ul className="pl-1 space-y-4 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <strong>Funds are committed up front</strong>
        <br />
        Once added, funds are locked for the duration of the election. They canâ€™t be refunded or withdrawn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SIV keeps the funds if no votes go missing</strong>
        <br />
        We get paid when we do our job. Like a doctor who only gets paid when patients stay healthy, weâ€™re rewarded for
        securing every accepted vote.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Public accountability, not private hope</strong>
        <br />
        Every claimâ€”or lack of claimsâ€”is publicly visible. If votes go missing, more funds make it more likely the
        bounty will be claimed, surfacing the issue. If no one does, we can all have more trust in the result.
      </li>
    </ul>

    {/* Why offer a guarantee? */}
    <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">Why offer a guarantee?</h2>
    <ul className="pl-1 space-y-4 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <strong>Build Voter Confidence</strong>
        <br />
        Voters are more likely to participate when they know the system is accountable and secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Demonstrate Integrity</strong>
        <br />A financial guarantee is your public promise: votes will be countedâ€”or voters will be compensated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Detect Issues Early</strong>
        <br />
        The reward encourages voters to check their own vote inclusion, surfacing problems fast if they exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create Public Trust</strong>
        <br />
        Everyone can see whether any funds were claimed or not. That transparency builds confidence in the final result.
      </li>
    </ul>
