      <p>
        Funding a guarantee shows voters your election takes integrity seriously: If any accepted votes are missing from
        the final tally, voters can claim a financial rewardâ€”backed by you, the election admin.

      <li>
        <strong>Build Voter Confidence</strong>
        <br />
        Voters are more likely to participate when they know the system is accountable and secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Demonstrate Integrity</strong>
        <br />A financial guarantee is your public promise: votes will be countedâ€”or voters will be compensated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Detect Issues Early</strong>
        <br />
        The guarantee incentivizes voters to check that their vote was included. This surfaces problems faster and
        increases transparency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible and Optional</strong>
        <br />
        You choose how much to guarantee. Start small, scale as needed.
