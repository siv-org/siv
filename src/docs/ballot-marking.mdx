# How to Demo Printing Out Marked Ballots

Once the votes have been unlocked:

1. In your [**Election Admin Dashboard**](https://siv.org/login), go to the **`Marked Ballots`** tab from the sidebar.

2. You should see a list of all of the unlocked votes converted into PDF images.

- Each vote will have its **Verification #** in the top right corner, for a complete audit trail.

3. There is a `Download All` button to print.
