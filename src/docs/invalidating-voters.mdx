# How to Remove Voters: Invalidating Voter Authorization Tokens

## Initial Steps:

1. In your [**Election Admin Dashboard**](https://login.siv.org), navigate to the **`Voters`** tab.

2. Check the box(es) for the voter(s) you want to invalidate.

3. In the top-left corner above the Voters table, click the trash can icon: <InvalidateVotersButton displayOnly />

## After Successful Invalidation:

The voter's row is struck through and greyed out.

SIV prevents accidentally sending invitations for invalidated tokens.

<Todo>Invalidated voter can still be revalidated again, to undo any mistakes.</Todo>

## The specific Invalidation process depends on the election stage:

---

### Scenario I: The voter hasn’t been invited yet

> The admin can easily invalidate uninvited voters to correct any mistakes.

**_Admin Interface:_**

- The admin is asked to confirm.

  > ### Are you sure you want to invalidate this voter & auth token?

---

### Scenario II: The voter was invited, but hasn’t voted yet

<Todo>

> The admin can decide whether to notify the voter or not.

**_Admin Interface:_**

- The admin is asked to confirm, with an additional option to notify the voter:
  > ### Are you sure?
  >
  > This voter was already invited to vote, \{x minutes ago}.
  >
  > Would you like to send them a new notification email that their token has been invalidated?
  >
  > **[ Cancel ]** / **[Invalidate without Notifying]** / **[Invalidate & Notify]**

</Todo>

**_Voter Interface:_**

<Todo>

- If the admin chose to notify the voter, the voter receives an email:

  > ### Your Voter Authorization Token has been invalidated.
  >
  > If you believe this was in error, you can press reply to write to the Election Administrator.

</Todo>

- The `/vote` page errors when given an invalidated token:

  > ### This voter authorization token was invalidated.

<Todo>

> If you believe this was in error, you can write a message to the Election Administrator:
>
> ---
>
> Write your message here... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **[ Submit ]**
>
> ---

</Todo>

### Scenario III: The voter already voted, but votes haven’t been unlocked and tallied yet

In the rare circumstance where a vote must be invalidated after it has already been submitted and accepted, SIV prioritizes security.

SIV allows admins to remove votes after they've been cast, but only in a transparent way, and with the vote contents still protected by encryption.

<Todo>

> The voter, Privacy Protectors, and public will all be able to see that the encrypted vote was invalidated.
>
> This ensures voters can be confident that submitted votes cannot be secretly removed.
>
> This is powered by a Merkle Tree, a powerful cryptographic data structure. This is like a blockchain, but very fast & environmentally-friendly.

</Todo>

**_Admin Interface:_**

- The admin is asked to confirm.
  > Are you sure you want to invalidate this voter & their submitted vote?
  >
  > The public will be able to see the vote was invalidated, but not its contents.

**_Voter Interface:_**

- The voter will receive a notification that their vote was invalidated.

  > ### Your Submitted Vote has been invalidated.
  >
  > If you believe this was in error, you can press reply to write to the Election Administrator.

- If they revisit the `/vote` page, above the Vote Confirmation screen, they will see a new error message about their vote being invalidated by the admin.

  > ### Your Submitted Vote was invalidated.
  >
  > If you believe this was in error, you can write a message to the Election Administrator:
  >
  > ***
  >
  > Write your message here... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **[ Submit ]**
  >
  > ***

<Todo>

**_Privacy Protectors Interface:_**

- They will see that an encrypted vote was invalidated by the admin.

</Todo>

**_General Public Interface:_**

- If they review the encrypted votes list, they will see that there was an invalidation issued for this submitted encrypted vote.

---

### Scenario IV: The voter voted, and the votes have already been unlocked and tallied

<Todo>

> This situation is extreme and is only to be used under the most unusual circumstances.
>
> All Privacy Protectors must explicitly opt-in again to re-unlock the updated list.
>
> All voters are transparently told about this.
